# GoLang Data Structures & Algorithms

A learning purpose project in Go. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with the Go Language while sharpening my understranding of data structures and most common algorithms.

## Algorithms :

- `bubble.go` : An implementation of the bubble sort algorithms.

## Data Structures :

- `stack.go` : An implementation for the stack data structure with its common interaction methods : push & pop.
- `linked_list.go` : An implementation for the linked list data structure with its common interaction methods : getNext, addToHead, addToTail, getData (current).
- `queue.go` : An implementation for the queue data structure with its common interaction methods : enqueue, dequeue, peek.
